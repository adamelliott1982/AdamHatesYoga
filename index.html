				Here at Adam Hates Yoga, we hate exercising even more than you do!  In fact, if we could sit on the couch all day eating sweet, sweet chocolate...we would!

			<h2>Stupid Machine!</h2>
			<p>
				Our bodies are machines that are designed to break down, and by building a customized vinyasa (flow), we will oil up that machine and check to see what's going on under the hood.  Let's get together and laugh at how goddamn stupid the human body is, and who knows? Maybe we will get some exercise by mistake!

					When practicing in a studio, there is an inherent "need to keep up".  Here at Adam Hates Yoga, we say forget that noise!  Together we will build you a cutomized vinyasa for your specific body type to achieve exponential growth!

					We love questions!  The more you know about your body, the faster we can address that tricky knee, that sore back, and that janky old hip.  Because here at Adam Hates Yoga, you can't possibly hate your body more than we hate our own, <a href="media/guarantee.jpg" target="blank">GUARANTEED!!!</a>
